# Investigating reasons why staff leave the LAS
## CUSP London Data Drive 2019 with the London Ambulance Service

We looked at the reasons why staff leave the LAS

- Commuting burden of staff (using patterns of current staff)
- Examined correlation between turnover rates by station and average commuting time
- Explored rental prices in and around London

As well as the data provided, we used co-ordinates for LAS stations extracted from [Grid Reference Finder](https://gridreferencefinder.com/postcodeBatchConverter), postcode sector boundaries downloaded from [University of Edinburgh](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2597), journey time data extracted from the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/) and rent prices downloaded from [the VOA](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/private-rental-market-summary-statistics-april-2017-to-march-2018).

Our presentation was put together in Tableau. The relevant data will need to be reconnected in order for the Tableau workbook to function correctly. 

NB. We are still waiting for the group member who did the travel time and turnover rate correlation analysis to share their Jupyter Notebook.
