# Better Understanding the demographics and needs of LAS patients
## CUSP London Data Drive 2019 with the London Ambulance Service

Our project goal was to better understand the demographic diversity in London.
We explored the data provided by the LAS and looked at the following aspects:
1. General trends or outliers in all responses in all of London. For this, we looked at every day of the year and identified wards that received an extraordinary number of calls on particular days.
2. The specific population behind callers of the NHS 111 service who get transferred to LAS. Are there any noticeable patterns? Do the NHS 111 callers differ from non 111 callers?
3. General trends or outliers for NHS 111 calls in all of London by hour. For this, we looked at the LSOA level.
4. Trends segmented by age group, gender, and criticality in NHS 111 calls.
5. Trends in non-conveyed emergencies arising from NHS 111 calls. Is there a specific population that seems to be getting ambulances when they should be going to the GP or a walk-in clinic?

### Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook in this folder explores points 1, 2, and partly 3. The rest of the analysis work for points 3, 4, and 5 were carried out using other tools like Excel, making its reproducibility much harder.
